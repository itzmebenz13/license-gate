    <h2>> Liability & Refunds</h2>
    <p>The seller is not liable for any loss of the buyer's capital if the SHEIN event terminates without prior notice. Access is permanent, but you acknowledge that SHEIN may shut down the event at any time.</p>
    <p class="warning">A refund is only possible if the event ends within <strong>3 days</strong> of your purchase date. Only <strong>30-40%</strong> of the purchase price will be refunded in this scenario.</p>
    <p>The QR seller is not responsible if the buyer fails to recover their capital due to high customer congestion from other booking agents or sources.</p>
    
    <h2>> Access & Security Protocols</h2>
    <p>Activation of your access requires your <strong>IP address</strong>. This is a mandatory step for system integration and security.</p>
    <p>The QR seller reserves the right to implement additional security methods and protocols at any time without prior notice to enhance system integrity.</p>
    <p>The QR seller is not responsible for the deactivation of your access if it is proven that you have shared your access credentials with other individuals. Access is non-transferable.</p>

    <h2>> User Responsibilities & Rules of Engagement</h2>
    <p class="warning">Your personal access QR is strictly for personal use. It <strong>cannot</strong> be used for booking orders for other people. This is considered a system breach.</p>
    <p>If the system detects irregularities in the shipping address being used with your personal access, your access will be permanently deactivated. Reinstatement is not possible.</p>
    <p>The QR seller can and will revoke your access without prior notice if it is proven that you have violated the rules, such as using your personal access for commercial booking purposes.</p>
